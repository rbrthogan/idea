  context: 'Generate a diverse list of 50 specific concepts for creating elegant high
    school math problems. Mix fields and techniques:

    - GEOMETRIC concepts (similar triangles, circle properties, Pythagorean triples,
    geometric transformations like rotation/reflection, area dissection, 3D visualization,
    vectors)

    - ALGEBRAIC techniques (telescoping series, Vieta''s formulas, AM-GM inequality,
    Cauchy-Schwarz, functional equations, polynomial roots, logarithms)

    - NUMBER THEORY concepts (modular arithmetic, divisibility rules, prime factorization,
    Diophantine equations, Fermat''s Little Theorem)

    - COMBINATORICS concepts (pigeonhole principle, inclusion-exclusion, constructive
    counting, coloring proofs, invariants)

    - LOGIC/STRATEGY concepts (working backwards, considering extreme cases, proof
    by contradiction, finding a pattern)

    - PROBABILITY concepts (geometric probability, expected value, conditional probability)

    Avoid overly complex or graduate-level topics. Focus on concepts that can be combined
    in surprising ways.

    Return the list as: CONCEPTS:<concept1>, <concept2>, <concept3>, <concept4>, <concept5>,
    ....'
  specific_prompt: 'From the following mathematical concepts, randomly select 2 or
    3 that could be combined to create a single, elegant problem:

    {context_pool}

    SELECTION STRATEGY: Pick concepts from different mathematical fields that don''t
    obviously belong together. The goal is to inspire a problem where the solution
    is non-obvious. For example, a geometry problem solved with number theory, or
    an algebra problem solved with a coloring argument.

    Create a brief request like: "Create a geometry problem involving [concept 1]
    whose solution uses the [concept 2]." or "Design a number theory problem about
    [concept 1] that can be visualized using [concept 2]."

    Your concise problem design prompt:'
  idea: 'Your response must be a math problem and its corresponding elegant solution.
    It must incorporate the following elements from the context pool:

    {context_pool}

    The problem must be:

    - Solvable by a high school student.

    - Designed to be solved in under 5 minutes.

    - Have a solution that is insightful and elegant, avoiding brute-force calculation.

    - Stated clearly and unambiguously.

    Proposed Problem:

    {idea}

    Please provide a critical review of this problem. Focus on:

    - **Clarity:** Is the problem statement unambiguous?

    - **Difficulty:** Is it appropriately challenging for a high school student? Is
    the "under 5 minutes" claim realistic?

    - **Elegance:** Is the intended solution genuinely elegant, or is it a standard
    procedure? Are there non-elegant brute-force solutions that are too easy?

    - **Soundness:** Is the problem mathematically correct? Are there any unstated
    assumptions?

    - **Originality:** Is the problem interesting and fresh, or is it a minor variation
    of a well-known classic?

    Provide your feedback concisely. No additional text, just the critique.'
  refine: 'Original Problem:

    {idea}

    Critique: {critique}

    You are an expert problem designer. Review the original problem and the critique.
    Now, create a refined version of the problem and its solution.

    Your refined version should:

    - Address the weaknesses identified in the critique (e.g., clarify wording, adjust
    difficulty, enhance elegance).

    - Preserve the core mathematical insight that made the original problem interesting.

    - Adhere strictly to the requirements: high school level, <5 min solve time, elegant
    solution.

  breed: '{ideas}

    Analyze the above math problems to identify patterns:

    1. Which mathematical fields (Geometry, Algebra, etc.) are most common?

    2. Which specific concepts or solution tricks (e.g., AM-GM, pigeonhole principle)
    are overused?

    3. What types of problems are underrepresented (e.g., functional equations, geometric
    probability)?

    Based on your analysis, create a new, novel math problem that:

    - Combines concepts from fields that were not previously combined.

    - Uses an underrepresented technique or concept.

    - Presents a familiar concept in a completely new context.

    The new problem must still be solvable by a high schooler in under 5 minutes with
    an elegant solution.

  genotype_encode: 'You are an expert mathematician skilled at deconstructing problems
    to their core components. Your task is to convert a full math problem (including
    its solution) into its basic genetic elements (genotype).

    The genotype for a math problem should capture:

    - Primary Math Field (e.g., "Geometry", "Algebra", "Number Theory")

    - Secondary Math Field (The field the solution technique comes from, if different,
    e.g., "Combinatorics")

    - Key Concepts (The specific theorems or ideas needed, e.g., "Vieta''s Formulas",
    "Similar Triangles", "Modular Arithmetic")

    - Solution Technique (The core insight or trick, e.g., "Symmetry Argument", "Telescoping
    Sum", "Invariance", "Geometric Transformation")

    - Problem Type (What is being asked, e.g., "Find a value", "Proof", "Optimization",
    "Locus")

    - Required Knowledge (The high-school curriculum area, e.g., "Algebra II", "Pre-Calculus",
    "Euclidean Geometry")

    Extract only the most fundamental elements.

    Example:

    Input:

    Problem: Find the area of the largest circle that can be inscribed in a sector
    of a circle of radius 1 and angle 60 degrees.

    Solution: The solution uses similar triangles formed by the center of the large
    circle, the center of the inscribed circle, and the point of tangency. This sets
    up a simple ratio to find the inscribed circle''s radius.

    Output: "Geometry; Euclidean Geometry; Circles; Tangency; Similar Triangles; Ratio
    Setup; Find a value"
