# Special requirements for this template type
special_requirements: |
  The body of the proposal should be written in markdown syntax with headings, paragraphs, bullet lists as appropriate.
  The research must be feasible for a single researcher with a single GPU (RTX 4090 or similar).
  Focus on efficient methods, pre-trained models, and small-scale experiments.
  Also please include a title, returning:
  Title: [Your creative title]
  Content: [Your research proposal]

prompts:
  context: |
    Generate a diverse list of 50 specific AI research concepts that are feasible with limited computational resources. Focus on efficiency and clever approaches rather than scale:
    - EFFICIENT techniques (parameter-efficient fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, quantization, pruning, etc.)
    - SMALL-SCALE applications (few-shot learning, meta-learning, transfer learning, data-efficient methods, online learning, online reinforcement learning, etc.)
    - PRE-TRAINED model usage (adapting foundation models, prompt engineering, in-context learning, etc.)
    - RESOURCE-CONSCIOUS domains (edge AI, mobile deployment, low-power inference, etc.)
    - CLEVER architectures (MobileNets, EfficientNets, lightweight transformers, depthwise convolutions, etc.)
    - EVALUATION methods (synthetic data generation, data augmentation, cross-validation, statistical analysis, etc.)
    - ANALYSIS techniques (mechanistic interpretability, probing, attention visualization, gradient analysis, etc.)
    - OPTIMIZATION approaches (learning rate scheduling, gradient accumulation, mixed precision, etc.)

    Avoid resource-intensive terms like "large-scale training", "distributed computing", "massive datasets", "foundation model training".
    Focus on concepts that leverage existing resources cleverly rather than requiring massive compute.
    Return as: CONCEPTS:<concept1>, <concept2>, <concept3>, <concept4>, <concept5>, ....

  specific_prompt: |
    From the following AI research concepts, randomly select 2 or 3 that would create an interesting combination for a GPU-poor research project:

    {context_pool}

    SELECTION STRATEGY: Pick concepts that create feasible research projects for a single researcher with one GPU. Examples include:
    - Leveraging pre-trained models efficiently

    - Parameter-efficient adaptations
    - Creative use of limited data
    - Interpretability and understanding
    - Toy problems for novel techniques

    Create a brief research direction like: "Investigate [efficient technique] for [specific application] using [resource-conscious approach]."

    Ensure the research can be completed with:
    - Single GPU (RTX 4090 or similar)
    - [Optionally] Pre-trained models as starting points if appropriate
    - Small to medium datasets
    - 3-6 month timeline for one researcher

    Your research proposal must incorporate 3-4 specific concepts from the context above as foundational elements. Choose concepts that create interesting intersections while remaining feasible for single-GPU research.

    Develop a research proposal where the methodology emphasizes:
    - Efficient use of computational resources
    - Leveraging pre-trained models and transfer learning
    - Creative approaches to limited data scenarios
    - Novel evaluation methods that don't require massive datasets
    - Techniques that can be implemented and tested on a single GPU

    The proposal should be scoped for a single researcher working 3-6 months with one high-end consumer GPU.

    Ensure the proposal clearly addresses:
    - Computational feasibility (single GPU constraints)
    - Use of pre-trained models or efficient architectures
    - Expected dataset sizes and sources
    - Timeline and resource requirements

    The input may be in the format:
    Title: [title text]
    Content: [content text]

    If no explicit title is provided, create an appropriate one based on the content.

  critique: |
    You are a helpful AI that refines ideas for GPU-poor research.
    Current Idea:
    {idea}

    Please consider the above proposal with specific attention to computational feasibility. Offer critical feedback on:
    - Whether it's truly feasible with a single GPU
    - If it relies too heavily on large-scale computation or data
    - Whether the timeline and scope are realistic for one researcher
    - If it leverages pre-trained models and efficient techniques appropriately
    - Potential pitfalls related to resource constraints as well as strengths
    - Whether the idea is novel and interesting

    If the idea doesn't have sufficient detail about computational requirements or feasibility,
    please suggest how to improve it and ask for elaboration on resource usage.
    No additional text, just the critique.

    Current Idea:
    {idea}

    Critique: {critique}

    Please review both, consider your own opinion and create your own proposal.
    This could be a refinement of the original proposal or a fresh take on it.
    Ensure the refined proposal is explicitly feasible for single-GPU research:
    - Has realistic data and computational requirements
    - Can be completed in 3-6 months by one researcher

    No additional text, just the refined idea on its own.
    Try have a sensible structure to the idea with markdown headings.
    It should be sufficiently detailed to convey the main idea and feasibility constraints.

  breed: |
    {ideas}
    Analyze the above research proposals to identify patterns:
    1. Which technical approaches and methodologies appear repeatedly
    2. What application domains are overused
    3. Which research gaps remain unexplored

    Create a new research proposal that either:
    - Explores technical approaches underrepresented in the proposals above
    - Targets application domains not heavily covered
    - Addresses research questions that emerge from combining diverse elements in novel ways

    Focus on research directions that maximize novelty while maintaining strict feasibility for single-GPU research.
    The proposal must be completable by one researcher in 3-6 months with consumer hardware.

  genotype_encode: |
    You are an expert at analyzing GPU-poor AI research proposals and extracting their fundamental building blocks. Your task is to convert a full research proposal into its basic genetic elements (genotype).

    For AI research proposals, the genotype should capture the essential components:
    - Core AI technique/method (e.g., "neural networks", "reinforcement learning", "transformer architecture")
    - Problem domain (e.g., "natural language processing", "computer vision", "robotics")
    - Key innovation/contribution (e.g., "attention mechanism", "few-shot learning", "multimodal fusion")
    - Application area (e.g., "medical diagnosis", "autonomous driving", "scientific discovery")
    - Technical approach (e.g., "supervised learning", "self-supervised", "adversarial training")
    - Evaluation method (e.g., "benchmark datasets", "human evaluation", "simulation")

    Extract only the most fundamental elements - strip away elaboration, examples, and implementation details. Think of it as the "research DNA" of the proposal.

    Format the genotype as a condensed list of these basic elements, separated by semicolons.

    Example 1:
    Input: "A novel transformer architecture for multi-modal medical image analysis that combines CT and MRI scans to improve diagnostic accuracy for neurological conditions using attention-based fusion mechanisms"
    Output: "transformer architecture; multi-modal learning; medical imaging; CT scans; MRI scans; attention fusion; neurological diagnosis; diagnostic accuracy"

    Example 2:
       Input: "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained vision transformers for few-shot medical image classification using LoRA adapters on a single RTX 4090"
    Output: "parameter-efficient fine-tuning; LoRA adapters; vision transformer; few-shot learning; medical imaging; single GPU; transfer learning"
