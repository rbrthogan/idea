# Special requirements for this template type
special_requirements: |
  The body of the proposal should be written in markdown syntax with headings, paragraphs, bullet lists as appropriate.
  Also please include a title, returning:
  Title: [Your creative title]
  Content: [Your research proposal]

prompts:
  context: |
    Generate a list of 50 AI research concepts. These concepts should be one of the following:
    a technique/method, an algorithm, an architecture, a dataset, a modality, a task, a problem/challenge, a solution, an application/use case, a future direction.
    Return the list of concepts as a single string, separated by commas with no other text in format:
    CONCEPTS:<concept1>, <concept2>, <concept3>, <concept4>, <concept5>, ....

  idea: |
    The above is some context to get you inspired.
    Using some or none of it for inspiration,
    suggest a promising area for novel research in AI (it can be a big idea, or a small idea, in any subdomain).
    keep it concise and to the point but with enough detail for a researcher to critique it.
    {requirements}

  new_idea: |
    You are an experienced researcher and you are given the preceding list of proposals.
    Considering the above ideas please propose a new idea, that could be completely new
    and different from the ideas above or could combine ideas to create a new idea.
    Please avoid minor refinements of the ideas above, and instead propose a new idea
    that is a significant departure.
    {requirements}

  format: |
    Take the following idea and rewrite it in a clear,
    structured format. The body of the proposal should be written in markdown syntax with headings, paragraphs, bullet lists as appropriate: {input_text}

  critique: |
    You are a helpful AI that refines ideas.
    Current Idea:
    {idea}

    Please consider the above proposal. Offer critical feedback.
    Pointing out potential pitfalls as well as strengths. If the idea doesn't have a clear structure,
    or sufficient detail, please suggest how to improve it and ask for elaboration of specific points of interest.
    No additional text, just the critique.

  refine: |
    Current Idea:
    {idea}

    Critique: {critique}

    Please review both, consider your own opinion and create your own proposal.
    This could be a refinement of the original proposal or a fresh take on it.
    No additional text, just the refined idea on its own.
    Try have a sensible structure to the idea with markdown headings.
    It should be sufficient detailed to convey main idea to someone in the field.

    {requirements}

  breed: |
    {ideas}
    You are an experienced ai researcher and you are given the above research proposals.
    These proposals received good feedback but were unable to be selected for funding. Your task it to create a new proposal that is better.
    This can be a combination of the best elements of the existing proposals, a refinement of the existing proposals or a completely new one that you were inspired to create.

    Importantly you will be judged on originality of the new proposal so need to make sure you bring something new to the table.
    Think outside the box and be creative.

  genotype_encode: |
    You are an expert at analyzing AI research proposals and extracting their fundamental building blocks. Your task is to convert a full research proposal into its basic genetic elements (genotype).

    For AI research proposals, the genotype should capture the essential components:
    - Core AI technique/method (e.g., "neural networks", "reinforcement learning", "transformer architecture")
    - Problem domain (e.g., "natural language processing", "computer vision", "robotics")
    - Key innovation/contribution (e.g., "attention mechanism", "few-shot learning", "multimodal fusion")
    - Application area (e.g., "medical diagnosis", "autonomous driving", "scientific discovery")
    - Technical approach (e.g., "supervised learning", "self-supervised", "adversarial training")
    - Evaluation method (e.g., "benchmark datasets", "human evaluation", "simulation")

    Extract only the most fundamental elements - strip away elaboration, examples, and implementation details. Think of it as the "research DNA" of the proposal.

    Format the genotype as a condensed list of these basic elements, separated by semicolons.

    Example:
    Input: "A novel transformer architecture for multi-modal medical image analysis that combines CT and MRI scans to improve diagnostic accuracy for neurological conditions using attention-based fusion mechanisms"
    Output: "transformer architecture; multi-modal learning; medical imaging; CT scans; MRI scans; attention fusion; neurological diagnosis; diagnostic accuracy"

    Genotype:

  genotype_decode: |
    You are an expert AI researcher who can develop complete research proposals from basic genetic elements. Your task is to convert a genotype (basic elements) into a comprehensive, well-structured AI research proposal.

    The genotype contains the essential building blocks. Your job is to:
    - Expand these elements into a coherent, detailed research proposal
    - Add technical depth, methodology, and implementation details
    - Structure it with clear problem statement, approach, and expected outcomes
    - Ensure it's feasible and addresses a meaningful research question
    - Maintain scientific rigor while adding context and elaboration

    Create a comprehensive research proposal that naturally incorporates all the genotype elements with proper academic structure and technical detail.

    Genotype elements: {genotype}

    Generate a full, detailed AI research proposal based on these elements:

  genotype_crossover: |
    You are a senior AI researcher performing genetic crossover on research proposal genotypes. Your task is to combine multiple parent genotypes to create a new, innovative research direction.

    Crossover rules for AI research:
    - Select the most promising techniques and methods from each parent
    - Combine problem domains in novel ways to create interdisciplinary approaches
    - Merge innovations to create hybrid or synergistic solutions
    - Ensure technical coherence while maximizing research novelty
    - Consider how different AI techniques can complement each other
    - Maintain scientific feasibility while pushing boundaries

    Parent genotypes:
    {parent_genotypes}

    Create a new research genotype by intelligently combining and potentially extending these elements. Focus on creating technically sound but innovative combinations that could lead to breakthrough research:

comparison_criteria:
  - "originality and novelty"
  - "potential impact and significance"
  - "feasibility and practicality"
  - "clarity and coherence"
