special_requirements: |
  Proposal constraints:
  - Feasible for one researcher using one consumer GPU (RTX 4090 class or similar).
  - Realistic 3-6 month scope with explicit compute/data assumptions.
  - Favor efficient methods, pre-trained models, and small-to-medium datasets.
  - Integrate 3-4 concrete technical concepts into one coherent plan.
  - Include: hypothesis, method, evaluation plan, key risks, and expected outcomes.
  - Write markdown content with clear headings and concise bullets where useful.
  - Avoid filler or generic survey prose.
  - Return exactly two labeled fields:
    Title: [concise proposal title]
    Content: [full markdown proposal]

prompts:
  context: |
    Generate a diverse list of 50 specific AI research concepts feasible with limited computational resources.
    Focus on efficiency and clever approaches rather than scale:

    - EFFICIENT techniques (parameter-efficient fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, quantization, pruning, etc.)
    - SMALL-SCALE applications (few-shot learning, transfer learning, data-efficient methods, online learning, etc.)
    - PRE-TRAINED model usage (adapting foundation models, prompt engineering, in-context learning, etc.)
    - RESOURCE-CONSCIOUS domains (edge AI, mobile deployment, low-power inference, etc.)
    - CLEVER architectures (MobileNets, EfficientNets, lightweight transformers, depthwise convolutions, etc.)
    - EVALUATION methods (synthetic data generation, data augmentation, cross-validation, statistical analysis, etc.)
    - ANALYSIS techniques (mechanistic interpretability, probing, attention visualization, gradient analysis, etc.)
    - OPTIMIZATION approaches (learning rate scheduling, gradient accumulation, mixed precision, etc.)

    Avoid resource-intensive terms like "large-scale training", "distributed computing", "massive datasets", "foundation model training".
    Return as: CONCEPTS:<concept1>, <concept2>, <concept3>, <concept4>, <concept5>, ...

  specific_prompt: |
    From the following AI research concepts, randomly select 2 or 3 that form an interesting and feasible single-GPU research direction:

    {context_pool}

    SELECTION STRATEGY:
    - Favor ideas that leverage pre-trained models efficiently.
    - Favor novel analysis/evaluation methods over brute-force scaling.
    - Keep scope realistic for one researcher in 3-6 months.

    Create a concise direction like:
    "Investigate [efficient technique] for [specific application] using [resource-conscious approach]."

    Your concise research prompt:

  example_idea_prompts: |
    - "Write a proposal for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained vision transformers for medical image classification with limited labeled data."
    - "Write a proposal for interpretability methods that explain how pre-trained language models process scientific text using attention visualization."
    - "Write a proposal for few-shot adaptation of pre-trained speech models to low-resource languages using meta-learning."
    - "Write a proposal for knowledge-distillation techniques that compress multimodal models for edge deployment."
    - "Write a proposal for evaluating synthetic data generation for training small computer-vision models in specialized domains."
    - "Write a proposal for dataset curation via pruning redundant samples using teacher-student learning dynamics."

  idea: |
    Generate one GPU-constrained AI research proposal from the selected direction.
    Apply all constraints below:
    {requirements}

  format: |
    You are a formatting assistant. Convert the input research proposal into a JSON object with "title" and "content" fields.

    The "content" field should contain the full proposal in markdown.
    Ensure feasibility details (compute, data scale, timeline) remain explicit.

    If the input has a clear title, use it. Otherwise, generate a suitable title.

    Input to format:
    {input_text}

  critique: |
    You are a rigorous reviewer for GPU-constrained AI research proposals.

    Current idea:
    {idea}

    Critique it with focus on:
    - True single-GPU feasibility
    - Data and experiment scope realism
    - Timeline realism for one researcher
    - Novelty beyond obvious baseline combinations
    - Failure modes and mitigation quality

    Use these constraints as the baseline:
    {requirements_digest}

    No additional text, just the critique.

  refine: |
    Current idea:
    {idea}

    Critique:
    {critique}

    Produce an improved proposal. It may be a refinement or a fresh take, but it must preserve feasibility and improve novelty/clarity.

    {requirements}

  breed: |
    {ideas}
    Generate one new proposal while following all constraints below:
    {requirements}

  genotype_encode: |
    You are an expert at analyzing GPU-constrained AI research proposals and extracting their core genetic elements.

    Capture:
    - Core method/technique
    - Problem domain
    - Key innovation
    - Application area
    - Technical training/adaptation approach
    - Evaluation method
    - Constraint profile (compute/data/time)

    Preserve hard constraints as explicit genotype tags:
    {requirements_digest}

    Extract only fundamental elements. Strip away elaboration and implementation detail.
    Format as a condensed semicolon-separated list.

    Example 1:
    Input: "A novel transformer architecture for multimodal medical image analysis that combines CT and MRI scans to improve diagnostic accuracy for neurological conditions using attention-based fusion mechanisms"
    Output: "transformer architecture; multimodal learning; medical imaging; CT/MRI fusion; neurological diagnosis; attention fusion; diagnostic accuracy"

    Example 2:
    Input: "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained vision transformers for few-shot medical image classification using LoRA adapters on a single RTX 4090"
    Output: "parameter-efficient fine-tuning; LoRA adapters; vision transformer; few-shot learning; medical imaging; single GPU; transfer learning"
