# Special requirements for this template type
special_requirements: |
  The body of the proposal should be written in markdown syntax with headings, paragraphs, bullet lists as appropriate.
  Also please include a title, returning:
  Title: [Your creative title]
  Content: [Your research proposal]

prompts:
  context: |
    Generate a diverse list of 50 specific AI research concepts. Mix cutting-edge and foundational elements:
    - SPECIFIC techniques (few-shot learning, diffusion models, neural architecture search, etc.)
    - CONCRETE applications (protein folding, autonomous navigation, music generation, etc.)
    - EMERGING areas (neurosymbolic AI, quantum ML, AI safety, etc.)
    - INTERDISCIPLINARY domains (computational biology, digital humanities, climate modeling, etc.)
    - NOVEL architectures (transformers, graph neural networks, mixture of experts, etc.)
    - EVALUATION methods (human preference learning, causal inference, robustness testing, etc.)

    Avoid generic terms like "deep learning", "AI", "machine learning", "neural networks", "classification".
    Return as: CONCEPTS:<concept1>, <concept2>, <concept3>, <concept4>, <concept5>, ....

  specific_prompt: |
    From the following AI research concepts, randomly select 2 or 3 that would create an interesting combination and create a single concise research request:

    {context_pool}

    SELECTION STRATEGY: Pick concepts that create surprising interdisciplinary connections. Avoid obvious pairings like "neural networks + computer vision". Look for unusual cross-domain combinations.

    Create a brief research direction like: "Develop research combining [technique] with [application area] to address [problem/challenge]."

    Avoid adding too many concepts that would make the request to complex.

    Your concise research prompt:

  example_idea_prompts: |
    - "Develop a research proposal on using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for creating realistic synthetic data for training autonomous vehicles."
    - "Propose a new method for explainable AI (XAI) in medical diagnosis, focusing on transformer models."
    - "Investigate the use of reinforcement learning for optimizing supply chain management in a post-pandemic world."
    - "Explore the intersection of AI and art, creating a system that can generate novel pieces of music in the style of a given composer."
    - "Design a study to assess the ethical implications of using AI in hiring and recruitment processes."

  idea: |
    Your research proposal must incorporate 3-4 specific concepts from the context above as foundational elements. Choose concepts that create interesting intersections or novel combinations.

    Develop a research proposal where the methodology, problem domain, and expected contributions all stem from these chosen context elements.

    {requirements}

  format: |
    Take the following idea and rewrite it in a clear,
    structured format. The content of the proposal should be written in markdown syntax with headings, paragraphs, bullet lists as appropriate:

    The input may be in the format:
    Title: [title text]
    Content: [content text]

    If no explicit title is provided, create an appropriate one based on the content.
    
    Input to format:
    {input_text}


  critique: |
    You are a helpful AI that refines ideas.
    Current Idea:
    {idea}

    Please consider the above proposal. Offer critical feedback.
    Pointing out potential pitfalls as well as strengths. If the idea doesn't have a clear structure,
    or sufficient detail, please suggest how to improve it and ask for elaboration of specific points of interest.
    No additional text, just the critique.

  refine: |
    Current Idea:
    {idea}

    Critique: {critique}

    Please review both, consider your own opinion and create your own proposal.
    This could be a refinement of the original proposal or a fresh take on it.
    No additional text, just the refined idea on its own.
    Try have a sensible structure to the idea with markdown headings.
    It should be sufficient detailed to convey main idea to someone in the field.

    {requirements}

  breed: |
    {ideas}
    Analyze the above research proposals to identify patterns:
    1. Which technical approaches and methodologies appear repeatedly
    2. What application domains are overused
    3. Which research gaps remain unexplored

    Create a new research proposal that either:
    - Explores technical approaches underrepresented in the proposals above
    - Targets application domains not heavily covered
    - Addresses research questions that emerge from combining diverse elements in novel ways

    Focus on research directions that maximize novelty while maintaining technical soundness.

  genotype_encode: |
    You are an expert at analyzing AI research proposals and extracting their fundamental building blocks. Your task is to convert a full research proposal into its basic genetic elements (genotype).

    For AI research proposals, the genotype should capture the essential components:
    - Core AI technique/method (e.g., "neural networks", "reinforcement learning", "transformer architecture")
    - Problem domain (e.g., "natural language processing", "computer vision", "robotics")
    - Key innovation/contribution (e.g., "attention mechanism", "few-shot learning", "multimodal fusion")
    - Application area (e.g., "medical diagnosis", "autonomous driving", "scientific discovery")
    - Technical approach (e.g., "supervised learning", "self-supervised", "adversarial training")
    - Evaluation method (e.g., "benchmark datasets", "human evaluation", "simulation")

    Extract only the most fundamental elements - strip away elaboration, examples, and implementation details. Think of it as the "research DNA" of the proposal.

    Format the genotype as a condensed list of these basic elements, separated by semicolons.

    Example:
    Input: "A novel transformer architecture for multi-modal medical image analysis that combines CT and MRI scans to improve diagnostic accuracy for neurological conditions using attention-based fusion mechanisms"
    Output: "transformer architecture; multi-modal learning; medical imaging; CT scans; MRI scans; attention fusion; neurological diagnosis; diagnostic accuracy"

    Genotype:

  genotype_decode: |
    You are an expert AI researcher who can develop complete research proposals from basic genetic elements. Your task is to convert a genotype (basic elements) into a comprehensive, well-structured AI research proposal.

    The genotype contains the essential building blocks. Your job is to:
    - Expand these elements into a coherent, detailed research proposal
    - Add technical depth, methodology, and implementation details
    - Structure it with clear problem statement, approach, and expected outcomes
    - Ensure it's feasible and addresses a meaningful research question
    - Maintain scientific rigor while adding context and elaboration

    Create a comprehensive research proposal that naturally incorporates all the genotype elements with proper academic structure and technical detail.

    Genotype elements: {genotype}

    Generate a full, detailed AI research proposal based on these elements:

  genotype_crossover: |
    You are a senior AI researcher performing genetic crossover on research proposal genotypes. Your task is to combine multiple parent genotypes to create a new, innovative research direction.

    Crossover rules for AI research:
    - Select the most promising techniques and methods from each parent
    - Combine problem domains in novel ways to create interdisciplinary approaches
    - Merge innovations to create hybrid or synergistic solutions
    - Ensure technical coherence while maximizing research novelty
    - Consider how different AI techniques can complement each other
    - Maintain scientific feasibility while pushing boundaries

    Parent genotypes:
    {parent_genotypes}

    Create a new research genotype by intelligently combining and potentially extending these elements. Focus on creating technically sound but innovative combinations that could lead to breakthrough research:



comparison_criteria:
  - "originality and novelty"
  - "potential impact and significance"
  - "feasibility and practicality"
  - "clarity and coherence"
