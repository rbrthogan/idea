# Special requirements for this template type
special_requirements: |
  The game should be simple enough that it can be implemented as a browser game without relying on lots of external assets.
  Anchor each concept in one recognizable classic browser/arcade archetype and add 1-2 focused twists. Keep scope tight and implementation-friendly.

  Implementation guardrails:
  - Technology: HTML5 Canvas + vanilla JavaScript (or minimal DOM). No heavy engines, no networking, no server state.
  - Scope: Prototype should be feasible in <1000 LOC. Avoid content-heavy assets; use geometric shapes and simple sounds.
  - Input: Keyboard arrows/WASD and/or mouse only. No multi-touch, no complex gestures.
  - Systems: Prefer grid-based logic or simple AABB collisions. No complex physics, pathfinding, or ML. Minimal randomness.
  - UX: Single-screen or simple level progression. Pause/reset/undo optional but simple.

  Required sections (use markdown headings):
  - Base Game & Twists: Name the classic base (e.g., "Base: Snake" or "Base: Tetris", etc) and list 1-2 specific twists.
  - Overview: One short paragraph.
  - Core Loop: 3-5 bullets describing repeatable player actions and feedback.
  - Mechanics: Entities, rules, collisions, state changes.
  - Controls: Precise key/mouse mapping.
  - Level/Progression: How difficulty increases without new complex systems.
  - Scoring/Win/Lose: Clear conditions.
  - Visuals & Audio: Low-asset approach.
  - Minimum Prototype: The absolute smallest slice to implement first.
  - Stretch Ideas (optional): 1-2 sensible extensions that do not explode scope.

  Format your response as:
  Title: [Your creative title]
  Content: [Your game design]

prompts:
  context: |
    Generate a diverse list of 60 specific concepts framed as "classic base + focused twist(s)" suitable for quick browser implementation.

    Choose from these classic bases (non-exhaustive):
    - Breakout/Arkanoid, Snake, Tetris, Pong, Pac-Man, Space Invaders/Asteroids, Frogger, Minesweeper, Sokoban, Pipe Mania, 2048/Threes, Wordle, Simon/Memory, 15-Puzzle/Sliding, Lunar Lander, Flappy Bird, Endless Runner, Match-3 (minimal), Single-screen platformer, Tower Defense (very simple lanes), Connect Four/Reversi (no advanced AI), Columns/Dr. Mario.

    Example twist axes (pick 1-2 per concept):
    - Wrapping edges; gravity flip; limited rewind/undo; push/pull; single special tile type; rotating board; shrink/expand playfield; dual-control with mirrored input; line-of-sight fog; timed gates; one enemy type with deterministic pattern; resource as timer; combo chains with caps.

    Light-weight themes to vary flavor only (no heavy asset burden):
    - Neon circuits, paper cutouts, monochrome LCD, underwater, cave chalk, starfield, emoji tiles.

    Output each concept as a short phrase using this schema:
    - Base: <classic>; Twist: <twist 1>[, <twist 2>]; Constraints: <1-2 concrete implementation constraints>

    Return as: CONCEPTS:<concept1>, <concept2>, <concept3>, <concept4>, <concept5>, ....

  specific_prompt: |
    From the following concepts, select exactly ONE classic base and ONE (optionally TWO) focused twist(s) that combine cleanly without adding new systems. Produce a concise design request:

    {context_pool}

    SELECTION STRATEGY:
    - Prefer bases that map directly to canvas and simple collisions/grids.
    - Prefer twists that modify constraints (inputs, space, timing) over adding complexsystems (inventory, crafting, dialogue, multi-agent AI).
    - Avoid scope creep combinations (e.g., platformer + tower defense + crafting).
    - Ensure the result is prototypeable in <1000 LOC.

    Create a brief design direction, e.g.:
    - "Design a fresh take on Snake with wrap-around edges and one 'ghost' segment that must be avoided as it replays the previous path."
    - "Design a Breakout variant where bricks slide horizontally each volley, creating shifting lanes."
    - "Design a Sokoban inspired games on a hex grid with one-time ice tiles."

    Your concise game design prompt:

  example_idea_prompts: |
    - "Design a fresh take on Tetris where cleared lines drop as obstacles into the next round (single-screen loop)."
    - "Design a Pong inspired game with triangular paddles that deflect at angle-dependent speeds."
    - "Design a game like Frogger with lane swapping and a limited-use freeze."
    - "Design a Minesweeper variant where flagged tiles slowly spread if not confirmed."
    - "Design a 2048 variant on a hex grid with a once-per-level rotate action."
    - "Design a twist on Sokoban where boxes are magnets with simple attract/repel rules."

  idea: |
    Your game design document must incorporate the selected classic base and twist(s) from the context pool and follow the required sections. Keep the scope small and implementation-focused.
    {context_pool}
    The document should be well-structured and provide: Base & Twists, Overview, Core Loop, Mechanics, Controls, Level/Progression, Scoring/Win/Lose, Visuals & Audio, Technical Notes, Minimum Prototype, Stretch Ideas.
    No additional text, just the game design document.

    You are a helpful AI that refines ideas.
    Current Idea:
    {idea}

    Please consider the above proposal. Offer critical feedback.
    Focus on: unclear core loop, unnecessary systems, ambiguous controls, and implementation feasibility on Canvas in 300-600 LOC. If structure or detail is lacking, request specifics.
    No additional text, just the critique.

    Current Idea:
    {idea}

    Critique: {critique}

    Please review both, consider your own opinion and create your own proposal.
    Prefer tightening scope, clarifying the core loop, simplifying systems.
    This could be a refinement of the original proposal or a fresh take on it.
    No additional text, just the refined idea on its own.

  breed: |
    {ideas}
    Analyze the above game designs to identify patterns:
    1. Which classic bases are overused vs underused
    2. Which twists are overused
    3. Which possibilities are not being explored

    Create a new game design that either:
    - Uses a classic base that is underrepresented above, OR
    - Applies a fresh twist to a common base while keeping systems minimal, OR
    - Combines a known base with a single constraint-changing twist

    Focus on designs that maximize originality while maintaining strict browser-game feasibility and tight scope.

  genotype_encode: |
    You are an expert game designer skilled at analyzing game concepts and extracting their fundamental design DNA. Your task is to convert a full game design into its basic genetic elements (genotype).

    For browser game designs, the genotype should capture the essential components:
    - Core gameplay mechanic (e.g., "matching", "physics-based", "tile placement", "real-time control")
    - Game genre/style (e.g., "puzzle", "arcade", "strategy", "action", "simulation")
    - Player interaction (e.g., "mouse clicking", "keyboard arrows", "drag-and-drop", "timing-based")
    - Game objective (e.g., "score maximization", "survival", "completion", "collection")
    - Visual elements (e.g., "grid-based", "sprite animation", "geometric shapes", "particle effects")
    - Difficulty progression (e.g., "increasing speed", "more obstacles", "complex patterns")
    - Game world/theme (e.g., "space", "abstract", "retro", "nature", "geometric")

    Extract only the most fundamental design elements - strip away story details, specific art descriptions, and implementation specifics. Think of it as the "gameplay DNA" of the design.

    Format the genotype as a condensed list of these basic elements, separated by semicolons.

    Example:
    Input: "A space-themed puzzle game where players rotate asteroid fragments to create complete circles while avoiding collision with moving space debris, with increasing rotation speed each level"
    Output: "rotation mechanic; puzzle genre; space theme; geometric completion; collision avoidance; increasing speed; circular patterns; mouse control"
