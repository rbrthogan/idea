special_requirements: |
  Game design constraints:
  - The game should be simple enough to implement as a browser game with minimal external assets.
  - Anchor in one recognizable classic browser/arcade base with 1-2 focused twists.

  Implementation guardrails:
  - Technology: HTML5 Canvas + vanilla JavaScript (or minimal DOM). No heavy engines, no networking, no server state.
  - Scope: Prototype should be feasible in <=1000 LOC. Avoid content-heavy assets; prefer geometric shapes and simple sounds.
  - Input: Keyboard arrows/WASD and/or mouse only. No multi-touch, no complex gestures.
  - Systems: Prefer grid-based logic or simple AABB collisions. No complex physics, pathfinding, or ML.
  - UX: Single-screen or simple level progression. Pause/reset/undo may exist but must be minimal.

  Required sections (markdown headings):
  - Base Game & Twists: Name the classic base and list 1-2 specific twists.
  - Overview: One short paragraph.
  - Core Loop: 3-5 bullets describing repeatable actions and feedback.
  - Mechanics: Entities, rules, collisions, state changes.
  - Controls: Precise key/mouse mapping.
  - Level/Progression: How difficulty increases without new complex systems.
  - Scoring/Win/Lose: Clear conditions.
  - Visuals & Audio: Low-asset approach.
  - Technical Notes: Minimal implementation notes (state model, collision model, timing).
  - Minimum Prototype: The smallest playable slice.
  - Stretch Ideas (optional): 1-2 extensions that do not explode scope.

  Output format:
  - Return exactly two labeled fields:
    Title: [game title]
    Content: [full markdown design document]
  - No extra analysis or commentary outside these fields.

prompts:
  context: |
    Generate a diverse list of 60 concepts framed as "classic base + focused twist(s)" suitable for quick browser implementation.

    Choose from these classic bases (non-exhaustive):
    - Breakout/Arkanoid, Snake, Tetris, Pong, Pac-Man, Space Invaders/Asteroids, Frogger, Minesweeper, Sokoban, Pipe Mania, 2048/Threes, Wordle, Simon/Memory, 15-Puzzle/Sliding, Lunar Lander, Flappy Bird, Endless Runner, Match-3 (minimal), single-screen platformer, very-simple-lane tower defense, Connect Four/Reversi (no advanced AI), Columns/Dr. Mario.

    Example twist axes (pick 1-2 per concept):
    - Wrapping edges; gravity flip; limited rewind/undo; push/pull; one special tile type; rotating board; shrink/expand playfield; mirrored input; line-of-sight fog; timed gates; one deterministic enemy pattern; timer-as-resource; capped combo chains.

    Light themes for flavor only (no asset burden):
    - Neon circuits, paper cutouts, monochrome LCD, underwater, cave chalk, starfield, emoji tiles.

    Output format rules:
    - One concept per line.
    - Use this schema exactly: Base=<classic> | Twist=<twist 1>[ + <twist 2>] | Constraints=<constraint 1> / <constraint 2>
    - Do not separate concepts with commas.

    Return as:
    CONCEPTS:
    - <concept 1>
    - <concept 2>
    - ...

  specific_prompt: |
    From the following concepts, select exactly ONE classic base and ONE (optionally TWO) focused twists that combine cleanly without adding new systems.
    Produce one concise design request.

    {context_pool}

    SELECTION STRATEGY:
    - Prefer bases that map directly to Canvas and simple collisions/grids.
    - Prefer twists that modify constraints (inputs, space, timing) over adding complex systems (inventory, crafting, dialogue, multi-agent AI).
    - Avoid scope-creep combinations.
    - Ensure the result is prototypeable within the stated implementation guardrails.

    Example directions:
    - "Design a fresh take on Snake with wrap-around edges and one ghost segment that replays the previous path."
    - "Design a Breakout variant where bricks slide horizontally each volley, creating shifting lanes."
    - "Design a Sokoban-inspired game on a hex grid with one-time ice tiles."

    Your concise game design prompt:

  example_idea_prompts: |
    - "Design a fresh take on Tetris where cleared lines drop as obstacles into the next round (single-screen loop)."
    - "Design a Pong-inspired game with triangular paddles that deflect at angle-dependent speeds."
    - "Design a game like Frogger with lane swapping and a limited-use freeze."
    - "Design a Minesweeper variant where flagged tiles slowly spread if not confirmed."
    - "Design a 2048 variant on a hex grid with a once-per-level rotate action."
    - "Design a twist on Sokoban where boxes are magnets with simple attract/repel rules."

  idea: |
    Generate one browser-game design document from the selected direction.
    Apply all constraints below:
    {requirements}

  format: |
    You are a formatting assistant. Convert the input game design into a JSON object with "title" and "content" fields.

    The "content" field should contain the full design document.
    If the input has a clear title, use it. Otherwise, generate a suitable title.

    Input to format:
    {input_text}

  critique: |
    You are a rigorous game-design reviewer.

    Current idea:
    {idea}

    Provide critical feedback on:
    - Core loop clarity
    - Scope discipline (no unnecessary systems)
    - Control clarity
    - Implementation feasibility against the template guardrails
    - Novelty of base+twist combination

    No additional text, just the critique.

    Current idea:
    {idea}

    Critique:
    {critique}

    Produce an improved design that tightens scope, clarifies the loop, and keeps the twist meaningful.
    It may be a refinement or a fresh take, but it must satisfy the template requirements.

  genotype_encode: |
    You are an expert game designer extracting the fundamental design DNA from browser game concepts.

    Capture:
    - Base archetype (classic game lineage)
    - Twist model (how the base is altered)
    - Core gameplay mechanic
    - Genre/style
    - Player interaction model
    - Objective/win condition
    - Progression pattern
    - Constraint profile (implementation envelope)

    Preserve hard constraints as explicit genotype tags:
    {requirements_digest}

    Extract only fundamental elements. Strip away incidental art/story detail.
    Format as a condensed semicolon-separated list.

    Example:
    Input: "A space-themed puzzle game where players rotate asteroid fragments to create complete circles while avoiding collision with moving debris, with increasing rotation speed each level"
    Output: "rotation puzzle; classic-arcade derivative; constrained movement twist; space theme; geometric completion objective; collision avoidance; increasing speed progression; mouse control"

comparison_criteria:
  - clarity and strength of the core loop
  - originality of the twist(s)
  - fun factor added by the twist(s)
  - implementability within the stated browser-game constraints
  - simplicity and readability of mechanics
  - feasibility for standard browser implementation (no heavy assets/engines)
