# Special requirements for this template type
special_requirements: |
  The game should be simple enough that it can be implemented as a browser game without relying on lots of external assets.
  The game complexity should similar in level to classic games like Breakout, Snake, Tetris, Pong, Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Frogger, Minesweeper, Tic Tac Toe, 2048, Wordle etc.
  Avoid being derivative of these but limit the ambition to the level of complexity of these games.
  You should format your idea with enough specificity that a developer can implement it.
  The body of the proposal should be written in markdown syntax with headings, paragraphs, bullet lists as appropriate.
  Also please include a title, returning:
  Title: [Your creative title]
  Content: [Your game design]

prompts:
  context: |
    Generate a list of 50 game design concepts. These concepts should be one of the following:
    a genre, a game style, a game mechanic, a game object, a game art concept, a gameplay loop, a goal/objective, a narrative/theme, a game world
    Return the list of concepts as a single string, separated by commas with no other text in format:
    CONCEPTS:<concept1>, <concept2>, <concept3>, <concept4>, <concept5>, ....

  idea: |
    You are a uniquely creative game designer.
    The above is some context to get you inspired.
    Using some or none of it for inspiration,
    suggest a new game design that is both interesting and fun to play.
    With key game mechanics and controls.

    {requirements}

  new_idea: |
    You are a uniquely creative game designer.
    You are given the preceding list of game designs.
    Considering the above ideas please propose a new idea, that could be completely new
    and different from the ideas above or could combine ideas to create a new idea.
    Please avoid minor refinements of the ideas above, and instead propose a new idea
    that is a significant departure.

    {requirements}

    Please take this drabble and return it unchanged in the requested JSON format:

    {input_text}

  critique: |
    You are a helpful AI that refines ideas.
    Current Idea:
    {idea}

    Please consider the above proposal. Offer critical feedback.
    Pointing out potential pitfalls as well as strengths. If the idea doesn't have a clear structure,
    or sufficient detail, please suggest how to improve it and ask for elaboration of specific points of interest.
    No additional text, just the critique.

  refine: |
    Current Idea:
    {idea}

    Critique: {critique}

    Please review both, consider your own opinion and create your own proposal.
    This could be a refinement of the original proposal or a fresh take on it.
    No additional text, just the refined idea on its own.

    {requirements}

  breed: |
    {ideas}
    You are an experienced game designer and you are given the above game designs.
    These designs received good feedback but the studio leadership passed on selecting them for development.
    Your task it to create a new design that is better, that will be more likely to be selected for development.
    This can be a combination of the best elements of the existing designs, a refinement of the existing designs or a completely new one that you were inspired to create.

    Importantly you will be judged on originality of the new design so need to make sure you bring something new to the table.
    Think outside the box and be creative.

  genotype_encode: |
    You are an expert game designer skilled at analyzing game concepts and extracting their fundamental design DNA. Your task is to convert a full game design into its basic genetic elements (genotype).

    For browser game designs, the genotype should capture the essential components:
    - Core gameplay mechanic (e.g., "matching", "physics-based", "tile placement", "real-time control")
    - Game genre/style (e.g., "puzzle", "arcade", "strategy", "action", "simulation")
    - Player interaction (e.g., "mouse clicking", "keyboard arrows", "drag-and-drop", "timing-based")
    - Game objective (e.g., "score maximization", "survival", "completion", "collection")
    - Visual elements (e.g., "grid-based", "sprite animation", "geometric shapes", "particle effects")
    - Difficulty progression (e.g., "increasing speed", "more obstacles", "complex patterns")
    - Game world/theme (e.g., "space", "abstract", "retro", "nature", "geometric")

    Extract only the most fundamental design elements - strip away story details, specific art descriptions, and implementation specifics. Think of it as the "gameplay DNA" of the design.

    Format the genotype as a condensed list of these basic elements, separated by semicolons.

    Example:
    Input: "A space-themed puzzle game where players rotate asteroid fragments to create complete circles while avoiding collision with moving space debris, with increasing rotation speed each level"
    Output: "rotation mechanic; puzzle genre; space theme; geometric completion; collision avoidance; increasing speed; circular patterns; mouse control"

  genotype_decode: |
    You are a creative game designer who can develop complete game concepts from basic design elements. Your task is to convert a genotype (basic elements) into a comprehensive, playable browser game design.

    The genotype contains the essential design building blocks. Your job is to:
    - Expand these elements into a coherent, fun game design
    - Add specific mechanics, controls, and visual design details
    - Structure it with clear rules, objectives, and progression
    - Ensure it's feasible for browser implementation (similar complexity to Tetris, Snake, etc.)
    - Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining simplicity
    - Include specific implementation details for a developer

    Create a complete game design that naturally incorporates all the genotype elements with clear mechanics and browser-appropriate scope.

    Genotype elements: {genotype}

    Generate a full, detailed browser game design based on these elements:

  genotype_crossover: |
    You are an innovative game designer performing genetic crossover on game design genotypes. Your task is to combine multiple parent genotypes to create a new, creative game concept.

    Crossover rules for game design:
    - Blend the most engaging mechanics from each parent
    - Combine genres in novel ways to create hybrid gameplay
    - Merge visual themes and interaction styles creatively
    - Ensure the resulting game remains simple enough for browser implementation
    - Maximize fun factor while maintaining coherent design
    - Create synergistic combinations where mechanics complement each other
    - Avoid overcomplexity - aim for elegant simplicity

    Parent genotypes:
    {parent_genotypes}

    Create a new game design genotype by intelligently combining and potentially mutating these elements. Focus on creating fun, feasible combinations that could result in an addictive browser game:

  - "fun factor"
  - "feasibility for simple standard browser implementation"
