# Special requirements for this template type
special_requirements: |
  The game should be simple enough that it can be implemented as a browser game without relying on lots of external assets.
  The game complexity should similar in level to classic games like Breakout, Snake, Tetris, Pong, Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Frogger, Minesweeper, Tic Tac Toe, 2048, Wordle etc.
  Ideally could be implemented in a few hundred lines of code.
  Avoid being derivative of these but limit the ambition to the level of complexity of these games.
  You should format your idea with enough specificity that a developer can implement it.
  The body of the proposal should be written in markdown syntax with headings, paragraphs, bullet lists as appropriate.
  Also please include a title, returning:
  Title: [Your creative title]
  Content: [Your game design]

prompts:
  context: |
    Generate a diverse list of 50 specific game design concepts. Mix concrete and abstract elements:
    - SPECIFIC mechanics (gravity manipulation, color switching, time reversal, magnetic attraction, etc.)
    - CONCRETE objects (bouncing balls, sliding blocks, growing plants, melting ice, etc.)
    - UNIQUE genres (reverse tower defense, social deduction, asymmetric co-op, etc.)
    - DISTINCTIVE themes (microscopic world, paper craft, sound visualization, etc.)
    - CREATIVE objectives (create harmony, spread rumors, solve mysteries, etc.)
    - INTEREESTING varations on classic games (3D pong, bang bang with AI and more weapons, first person snake game, etc.)

    Avoid generic terms like "puzzle", "action", "shooting", "jumping", "collecting".
    Return as: CONCEPTS:<concept1>, <concept2>, <concept3>, <concept4>, <concept5>, ....

  specific_prompt: |
    From the following game design concepts, randomly select 2 or 3 that would create an interesting combination and create 1 concise design request:

    {context_pool}

    SELECTION STRATEGY: Pick concepts that create surprising gameplay synergies. Avoid predictable pairings like "puzzle + matching" or "action + shooting". Don't include too many concepts that would make the game too complex.

    Create a brief design direction like: "Design a [genre/type] game that combines [mechanic] where players [objective]." Or "Design a game that combines [interaction] with [theme/setting]."

    Your concise game design prompt:

  example_idea_prompts: |
    - "Design a puzzle game where the player manipulates gravity to solve challenges."
    - "Create a concept for a platformer game set in a that utilises changing weather as a core mechanic."
    - "Outline a strategy game where players control the immune system to fight off an infection."
    - "Design a web browser game that puts a new twist on the classic breakout game."
    - "Create a narrative-driven game about a character who is losing their memories."
    - "Create a spaceship shooter game where the player can control multiple ships at once."

  idea: |
    Your game design document must incorporate the following elements from the context pool:
    {context_pool}
    The document should be well-structured and provide a clear overview of the game concept.
    It should include sections on gameplay mechanics, art style, and target audience.
    No additional text, just the game design document.

  format: |
    Please take this game design and return it unchanged in the requested JSON format:

    The input may be in the format:
    Title: [title text]
    Content: [content text]

    If no explicit title is provided, create an appropriate one based on the content.

    You are a helpful AI that refines ideas.
    Current Idea:
    {idea}

    Please consider the above proposal. Offer critical feedback.
    Pointing out potential pitfalls as well as strengths. If the idea doesn't have a clear structure,
    or sufficient detail, please suggest how to improve it and ask for elaboration of specific points of interest.
    No additional text, just the critique.

    Critique: {critique}

    Please review both, consider your own opinion and create your own proposal.
    This could be a refinement of the original proposal or a fresh take on it.
    No additional text, just the refined idea on its own.

  breed: |
    {ideas}
    Analyze the above game designs to identify patterns:
    1. Which gameplay mechanics and styles appear repeatedly
    2. What themes and genres are overused
    3. Which design elements remain unexplored

    Create a new game design that either:
    - Uses mechanics underrepresented in the designs above
    - Explores themes and genres not heavily covered
    - Combines elements in ways that haven't been tried yet

    Focus on designs that maximize originality while maintaining browser-game feasibility.

  genotype_encode: |
    You are an expert game designer skilled at analyzing game concepts and extracting their fundamental design DNA. Your task is to convert a full game design into its basic genetic elements (genotype).

    For browser game designs, the genotype should capture the essential components:
    - Core gameplay mechanic (e.g., "matching", "physics-based", "tile placement", "real-time control")
    - Game genre/style (e.g., "puzzle", "arcade", "strategy", "action", "simulation")
    - Player interaction (e.g., "mouse clicking", "keyboard arrows", "drag-and-drop", "timing-based")
    - Game objective (e.g., "score maximization", "survival", "completion", "collection")
    - Visual elements (e.g., "grid-based", "sprite animation", "geometric shapes", "particle effects")
    - Difficulty progression (e.g., "increasing speed", "more obstacles", "complex patterns")
    - Game world/theme (e.g., "space", "abstract", "retro", "nature", "geometric")

    Extract only the most fundamental design elements - strip away story details, specific art descriptions, and implementation specifics. Think of it as the "gameplay DNA" of the design.

    Format the genotype as a condensed list of these basic elements, separated by semicolons.

    Example:
    Input: "A space-themed puzzle game where players rotate asteroid fragments to create complete circles while avoiding collision with moving space debris, with increasing rotation speed each level"
    Output: "rotation mechanic; puzzle genre; space theme; geometric completion; collision avoidance; increasing speed; circular patterns; mouse control"
