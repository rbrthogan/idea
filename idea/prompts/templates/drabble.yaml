# Special requirements for this template type
special_requirements: |
  A drabble is a short work of fiction exactly 100 words in length (not including the title).
  Despite its brevity, a drabble should tell a complete story with a beginning, middle, and end.

  Your story will be judge on creativity, originality, and the ability to tell a complete story in 100 words.

  Try to avoid common cliché "creative" words like "Echo", "Crimson", "Bloom", "Shadow", "Whisper", "Ember", "Ash", "Veil", "Legacy" etc.
  This smacks of beginning writers who are trying to be creative but are actually just imitating more seasoned writers.

  Try to be original and creative with your choice of words.

  Title: [Your creative title]
  Content: [Your 100-word story]
