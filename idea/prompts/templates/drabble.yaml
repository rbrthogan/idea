    Title: [short evocative title]
    Content: [exactly 100-word drabble]

prompts:
  context: |
    Generate a diverse list of 50 specific English words/concepts for creative writing inspiration. Mix concrete and abstract elements:

    - SPECIFIC genres (noir, cosmic horror, slice-of-life, magical realism, western, historical, pastoral, comedy, etc.)
    - CONCRETE settings (lighthouse, subway car, boarding school, space station, monastery, cafeteria, etc.)
    - CHARACTER TYPES (single mother, desperate thief, rising sports star, firefighter, pensioner, house cat, pack mule, ancient redwood tree, talking dog, etc.)
    - CONCRETE objects (music box, stethoscope, origami crane, broken bicycle, gas mask, etc.)
    - THEMES (loneliness, triumph, changing of the guard, betrayal, coming of age, revenge, personal growth, etc.)
    - SPECIFIC emotions (nostalgia, schadenfreude, saudade, jealousy, embarrassment, etc.)

    Do not regurgitate this list; it is illustrative only.

    Return as: CONCEPTS:<concept1>, <concept2>, <concept3>, <concept4>, <concept5>, ...

  specific_prompt: |
    From the following concepts, randomly select 2 or 3 that create an interesting combination and produce one simple, concise story direction:

    {context_pool}

    SELECTION STRATEGY: Pick concepts that work well together. Avoid combining so many elements that the story becomes muddy.

    Create a brief request like:
    - "Write a [genre/style] drabble about a [character type] dealing with [concept]."
    - "Write a drabble set in a [setting] centered on [theme]."

    Your concise story prompt:

  example_idea_prompts: |
    - "Write a 100-word story about a sentient teapot that is afraid of the dark."
    - "In exactly 100 words, describe the last moments of a star."
    - "A 100-word story about a detective who solves crimes by talking to ghosts."
    - "Write a drabble about a child who finds a door to another world in their closet."
    - "A 100-word story about a robot who learns to love."

  idea: |
    Generate one drabble from the selected direction.
    Apply all constraints below:
    {requirements}

  format: |
    You are a formatting assistant. Your task is to take the input text and structure it into a JSON object with "title" and "content" fields.

    If the input has a clear title (e.g. "Title: X"), use it. If not, generate a suitable title based on the content.

    The "content" field should contain the body of the story.

    Input to format:
    {input_text}

  critique: |
    You are a creative-writing professor reviewing drabble assignments.

    Drabble from a promising student:
    {idea}

    Provide critical feedback on strengths and weaknesses.
    If the story fails the drabble form, lacks a clear narrative arc, or feels derivative/banal, explain what to improve.

    No additional text, just the critique.

  refine: |
    You are a professional creative writer refining a drabble based on critique.

    Original drabble:
    {idea}

    Critique:
    {critique}

    Create a refined version that addresses the critique while preserving the core creative elements and unusual concepts that make the story distinctive.
    Write exactly 100 words: a complete story, not a description.

  breed: |
    {ideas}
    Generate one new drabble while following all constraints below:
    {requirements}

  genotype_encode: |
    You are an expert literary analyst skilled at deconstructing stories into their fundamental narrative DNA.
    Convert a complete drabble into its basic genetic elements (genotype).

    Capture:
    - Genre/style
    - Central conflict
    - Character archetype
    - Setting/atmosphere
    - Narrative technique
    - Emotional core
    - Thematic element

    Preserve hard constraints as tags when relevant:
    {requirements_digest}

    Extract only fundamental elements. Strip away plot specifics, names, and incidental details.

    Format as a condensed semicolon-separated list.

    Example:
    Input: "Sarah's fingers trembled as she opened the letter. Twenty years later, and Mom's handwriting still made her heart race. 'I forgive you,' it read. But Mom had been dead for five years. Sarah laughed through tears, finally understanding. The letter was in her own handwriting - a message from her younger self, hidden and forgotten until now. Sometimes forgiveness comes from the most unexpected places."
    Output: "psychological realism; guilt and redemption; mother-daughter relationship; domestic setting; twist ending; self-forgiveness; time/memory; epistolary element"
