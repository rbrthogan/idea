# Special requirements for this template type
special_requirements: |
  A drabble is a short work of fiction exactly 100 words in length (not including the title).
  Despite its brevity, a drabble should tell a complete story with a beginning, middle, and end.

  Your story will be judge on creativity, originality, and the ability to tell a complete story in 100 words.

  Try to avoid common cliché "creative" words like "Echo", "Crimson", "Bloom", "Shadow", "Whisper", "Ember", "Ash", "Veil", "Legacy" etc.
  This smacks of beginning writers who are trying to be creative but are actually just imitating more seasoned writers.

  Try to be original and creative with your choice of words.

  Format your response as:
  Title: [Your creative title]
  Content: [Your 100-word story]

prompts:
  context: |
    Generate a diverse list of 50 specific English words/concepts for creative writing inspiration. Mix concrete and abstract elements:
    - SPECIFIC genres (noir, cosmic horror, slice-of-life, magical realism, cyberpunk, pastoral, etc.)
    - CONCRETE settings (lighthouse, subway car, boarding school, space station, monastery, etc.)
    - SPECIFIC character types (forensic accountant, street mime, lighthouse keeper, etc.)
    - CONCRETE objects (music box, stethoscope, origami crane, etc.)
    - UNUSUAL themes (impostor syndrome, collective memory, technological loneliness, etc.)
    - SPECIFIC emotions (nostalgia, schadenfreude, saudade, etc.)

    Avoid generic terms like "mystery", "fantasy", "love", "death", "hero", "conflict".
    Return the list as: CONCEPTS:<concept1>, <concept2>, <concept3>, <concept4>, <concept5>, ....

  specific_prompt: |
    From the following concepts, randomly select 2 or 3 that would create an interesting combination and create 1 simple, concise prompt:

    {context_pool}

    SELECTION STRATEGY: Pick concepts that might make an interesting story together. Don't include too many concepts that would make the story too complex.

    Create a brief request like: "Write a [genre/style] drabble about a [character type] dealing with [concept]." Or "Write a drabble set in a [setting] about a exploring this [theme]."

    Your concise prompt:

  idea: |
    Your story must be built around 3-4 specific concepts from the context above. Choose concepts that naturally fit together and weave them into every aspect of your story - the character, setting, conflict, and resolution should all stem from these chosen elements.

    Write a complete drabble (exactly 100 words) that would be impossible to tell without these specific context elements as the foundation.

  format: |
    Please take this drabble and parse it into the correct JSON format.

    The input may be in the format:
    Title: [title text]
    Content: [content text]

    If no explicit title is provided, create an appropriate one based on the content.

    Input to format:

    You are a professor of creative writing that reviewing drabble assignments.
    Drabble from a promising student:
    {idea}

    Please consider the above story and offer critical feedback.
    Pointing out weaknesses as well as strengths. If the story doesn't fit the drabble format or have a clear narrative arc,
    or is too derivative or banal, please suggest how to improve it.
    No additional text, just the critique.

  refine: |
    You are a professional creative writer refining a drabble based on critique.

    Original Drabble:
    {idea}

    Critique: {critique}

    Create your refined version that addresses the critique while preserving the core creative elements and unusual concepts that make the story distinctive. The refined drabble should maintain whatever unique setting, character types, or themes made the original interesting.

    Write exactly 100 words - a complete story, not a description.

    {requirements}

  breed: |
    {ideas}
    You are a professional creative writer. Based on the above drabbles, create a new drabble that either:
    - Takes the LEAST represented elements from the stories above, OR
    - Combines elements that haven't been combined before, OR
    - Shifts to a completely different genre/tone/setting than what dominates above

    Prioritize novelty and avoiding repetitive patterns while maintaining story quality.

    IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any analysis, commentary, or meta-discussion in your response.
    Return ONLY the new creative drabble story - no analysis of the parent stories.

  genotype_encode: |
    You are an expert literary analyst skilled at deconstructing stories into their fundamental narrative DNA. Your task is to convert a complete drabble (100-word story) into its basic genetic elements (genotype).

    For drabbles, the genotype should capture the essential storytelling components:
    - Genre/style (e.g., "science fiction", "horror", "slice of life", "magical realism", "noir")
    - Central conflict (e.g., "internal struggle", "person vs nature", "moral dilemma", "time pressure")
    - Character archetype (e.g., "reluctant hero", "wise elder", "lost child", "conflicted professional")
    - Setting/atmosphere (e.g., "urban decay", "isolated wilderness", "domestic space", "dystopian future")
    - Narrative technique (e.g., "twist ending", "stream of consciousness", "dialogue-driven", "unreliable narrator")
    - Emotional core (e.g., "loss and acceptance", "fear and courage", "love and sacrifice", "guilt and redemption")
    - Thematic element (e.g., "identity", "mortality", "connection", "transformation", "memory")

    Extract only the most fundamental narrative elements - strip away specific plot details, character names, and setting specifics. Think of it as the "story DNA" of the drabble.

    Format the genotype as a condensed list of these basic elements, separated by semicolons.

    Example:
    Input: "Sarah's fingers trembled as she opened the letter. Twenty years later, and Mom's handwriting still made her heart race. 'I forgive you,' it read. But Mom had been dead for five years. Sarah laughed through tears, finally understanding. The letter was in her own handwriting—a message from her younger self, hidden and forgotten until now. Sometimes forgiveness comes from the most unexpected places."
    Output: "psychological realism; guilt and redemption; mother-daughter relationship; domestic setting; twist ending; self-forgiveness; time/memory; epistolary element"

    Genotype:

  genotype_decode: |
    You are a masterful creative writer who can craft complete stories from basic narrative elements. Your task is to convert a genotype (basic elements) into a complete, compelling 100-word drabble.

    The genotype contains the essential storytelling building blocks. Your job is to:
    - Weave these elements into a complete narrative arc with beginning, middle, and end
    - Create specific characters, dialogue, and concrete details
    - Build a vivid setting and atmosphere
    - Ensure the story is exactly 100 words (not including title)
    - Make it emotionally impactful and memorable
    - Avoid clichés and overused tropes while incorporating the genetic elements naturally

    Create a complete drabble that naturally incorporates all the genotype elements while telling a compelling, original story.

    Genotype elements: {genotype}

    Generate a complete, exactly 100-word drabble based on these elements:

  genotype_crossover: |
    You are an innovative creative writer performing genetic crossover on story genotypes. Your task is to combine multiple parent genotypes to create a new, compelling narrative direction while avoiding repetitive patterns.

    First, analyze the parent genotypes to identify:
    1. Which genres, themes, and character archetypes appear repeatedly across parents
    2. Which elements are overused or becoming predictable
    3. Which combinations have not been explored yet

    Crossover rules for drabbles:
    - PRIORITIZE rare or underused elements from the parents over common ones
    - Combine genres and techniques in unexpected but coherent ways
    - If similar character archetypes dominate, shift to less represented ones
    - If certain emotional cores repeat, explore contrasting or unexplored emotions
    - Create synergistic combinations that haven't been seen before
    - Push toward narrative novelty while maintaining coherence
    - Focus on unique emotional impact and fresh thematic depth

    Parent genotypes:
    {parent_genotypes}

    Create a new narrative genotype that deliberately combines the LEAST common elements from the parents, or finds entirely new combinations that maximize originality and avoid repetitive patterns:


comparison_criteria:
  - "creativity"
  - "originality"
  - "completeness"
  - "impact"
  - "adherence to the drabble format (an actual 100 word story - not a description of a story or a review of a story)"
  - "avoiding cliché, tropes, or overused words, characters, phrases, concepts, etc."
