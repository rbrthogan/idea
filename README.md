# idea

This is a simple app that uses an iterative algorithm (~ evolution inspired) to evolve ideas generated by an LLM.

How it works:

1. Generate some random context for the LLM to generate ideas
2. Generate some initial ideas
3. Improve the ideas (critique and refine)
4. Group ideas into groups of 5
5. Remove the worst idea from each group
6. Generate new ideas with group as context to replace the worst ideas
7. Repeat
8. Ideas can then be reviewed and rated by humans or LLMs to build up ELO rankings

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Setup API key:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Note: You can get an API key from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/).

## Run

There are two main components:

### Idea Generator & Viewer
To run the idea evolution process:
```bash
uvicorn idea.viewer:app
```

It will currently have to complete the full evolution before you can see the app.

Navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see the app.

Be sure to save the evolution results to later load into the rater

### Idea Rater

To run the idea rater:
```bash
uvicorn idea.rater:app --port 8001
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) to see the app.

You can rater ideas via pairwise comparison, viewing the mean ELO rating by generation, and view the ranking.


## TODO

- combine viewer and rater into one app
- Do automated rating with LLM
- Update to evolution to use the genotype/phenotype model
- Have an evolution variant to take human ratings as input during evolution
