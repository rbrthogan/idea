# idea

This is a simple app that uses a iterative algorithm (~ evolution inspired) to evolve ideas generated by an LLM.


How it works:

1. Generate some random context for the LLM to generate ideas
2. Generate some initial ideas
3. Improve the ideas (critique and refine)
4. Group ideas into groups of 5
5. Remove the worst idea from each group
6. Generate new ideas with group as context to replace the worst ideas
7. Repeat

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

setup api key
```
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Note: You can get an api key from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/).

## Run

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

It will currently have to complete the full evolution before you can see the app.

Navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see the app.
