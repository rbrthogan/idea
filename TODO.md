## Research Ideas
- Update to evolution to use the genotype/phenotype model
- Have an evolution variant to take human ratings as input during evolution
- TODO: use embeddings to monitor similarity/diversity of ideas, track in UI, and maybe cull duplicates ()
- TODO: add a modifier to each generations prompt based on critique feedback on overall quality of generation (or perhaps all history, could even show it the ranks, etc.) -- Oracle prompt. Remove worst idea and replace with new one generated from oracle prompt each generation. Track impact on evolution.
- Add a meta prompt to get the model to improve the new idea generation prompts based on the history of the evolution.
